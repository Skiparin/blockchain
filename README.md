## How to reporduce the setup

First go to the directory of your choise.

To clone the project type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Skiparin/blockchain
```

Now you will have the project on the machines.

Then enter the folder:
```
cd blockchain/
```

Inside the folder you will have two docker files `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. These are the files we will use to setup the inveioment with the four p2p nodes.

So now you want to build your image: (It is important that you do this inside the blockchain folder, and dont forget the `.` at the end!)
```
docker build -t blockchain .
``` 

Confirm the image: 
```
docker images
```
check for the image with the name `blockchain`.

Now that you got your images you can get your docker containers up and running.
To run the docker-compose type:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` tells docker to run the container detached.

Check for the four contianers:
```
docker ps -a
```

This will list all containers, you should see four containers named: peer1, peer2, peer3 and peer4.
